# CaQR
This repository contains Pytorch-based code implementing CaQR. CaQR can be applied to query embedding-based methodologies such as Query2Box, BetaE, and ConE.

## Implementation Detail

1. Make _data_ directory for each folder.
2. Download the query dataset from [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/betae/KG_data.zip).
3. Execute {model}_caqr.sh file.
