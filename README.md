# CaQR
This repository contains Pytorch-based code implementing of paper "Improving Multi-hop Logical Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs with Context-Aware Query Representation Learning". 

We CaQR can be applied to query embedding-based methodologies such as Query2Box, BetaE, and ConE.

This repository is based on \[KGReasoning][link]

## Implementation Detail

1. Make _data_ directory for each folder.
2. Download the query dataset from [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/betae/KG_data.zip).
3. Execute {model}_caqr.sh file.
