# CaQR
This repository contains Pytorch-based code implementing of paper "Improving Multi-hop Logical Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs with Context-Aware Query Representation Learning". 

Our CaQR can be applied to query embedding-based methodologies such as Query2Box, BetaE, and ConE.

This repository is based on KGReasoning([link])
